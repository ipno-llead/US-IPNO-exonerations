    "In the previous chapter of this series, we explored the application of large language models (LLMs) for structured information extraction from wrongful conviction case files using retrieval augmented generation (RAG). However, recent advancements in LLM technology have necessitated a re-evaluation of our information extraction pipeline. Models like Gemini 1.5 Pro with its one million token context window and Claude 3 Opus/Sonnet/Haiku with a 200k context window now allow entire documents to fit within a single context window, potentially eliminating the need for retrieving specific document pages. Furthermore, the emergence of cost-effective yet high-performing models like Claude Haiku make it feasible to iterate over every page in a document, rather than attempting to extract only the most relevant pieces for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This follow-up chapter aims to reconsider the fundamentals of our information extraction pipeline and explore the impact of both larger proprietary models and emerging open-source alternatives on our research. Our approach—evaluating LLMs in legal research by focusing on entity extraction—aligns with recent computational law research suggesting that AI might be more effective in narrow, well-defined legal applications [1](https://journalcrcl.org/crcl/article/view/62/28). By concentrating on the specific task of identifying police officers in wrongful conviction case files, we can assess LLM performance in a constrained legal context that is more amenable to large-scale evaluation due to its relative simplicity. This targeted approach differs from more complex tasks, such as writing legal briefs, attempted by generative AI legal research tools like Lexis+ AI and Casetext, which recent studies have shown to be susceptible to high rates of hallucination [2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.20362). Unlike generative tasks where correctness can be subjective, identifying specific entities allows for clear, binary assessments of performance (correct identification vs. incorrect or missed identification), enabling more robust and quantifiable evaluation metrics. While our approach may still produce false positives, entity extraction tasks are generally less susceptible to the negative effects of hallucination, as these errors can often be identified and mitigated through careful prompt engineering. This focused approach allows us to develop techniques that can potentially extend to other entities (e.g., witnesses, victims, locations, evidence, legal precedents) and legal document types, while providing a more robust framework for assessing and improving AI performance in legal applications."

    "Model performance was evaluated based on recall scores. Recall measures the proportion of police officers that were correctly identified by each model. To account for the stochastic nature of these models, we conducted a repeated analysis on a single representative configuration: Claude Haiku with the all pages approach. This choice was based on Claude Haiku's performance being in the middle between Mixtral models and Claude models in this analysis, as well as the comprehensive nature of the all pages approach. Over five runs, we observed a margin of error of ±0.029. While this variability is specific to this configuration, due to costs associated with running each process five times, it's expected to be a reasonable representation of the overall margins of error across different models and approaches.\n",

    "The all pages analysis approach consistently outperformed other methods across all tested models. The full context approach, despite its theoretical potential, demonstrated significant limitations in practice. This is likely due to the many known issues associated with use of the full context window [3], including degraded retrieval performance with increasing context length, impaired reasoning capabilities over multiple facts, and susceptibility to information overload. Given that the NER-based approaches are essentially derivatives of the all pages method, and considering the superior performance of the all pages models, the rest of this post will focus exclusively on this approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the Mixtral models scored lower than their Claude counterparts, their performance is notable given Mixtral's ability to run locally, offering cost-effectiveness and data privacy benefits. Importantly, these scores were achieved using prompts originally designed for Claude, suggesting potential for further improvement with Mixtral-specific optimizations. This combination of solid performance, local execution capability, and room for optimization makes Mixtral models a compelling option for certain use cases, particularly when balancing performance against data privacy considerations.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the Mixtral models offer unique advantages in terms of local execution and data privacy, the Claude models were clearly the most performative. In particular, Claude 3 Haiku achieved an overall recall score of 0.912 (or 212 out of 232 entities correctly identified), on par with Claude Sonnet 3.5, despite being a much smaller model.\n",
    "\n",
    "To put this in perspective, Claude 3 Haiku correctly identified 16 out of 17 entities in a 227-page transcript document at a cost of \\$0.12, significanly lower than the costs of Claude 3.5 Sonnet (\\$1.53) and Claude 3 Opus (\\$7.65). A human performing the same task would take approximately 5 hours, assuming an average reading speed of 225 words per minute and additional time for entity identification. At a rate of \\$30 per hour, the human labor cost would be around \\$150. This stark contrast—5 hours and \\$150 for a human versus near-instantaneous processing and \\$0.12 for Claude 3 Haiku—underscores the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of AI in such tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the dollar cost comparison is useful for illustrating the advantages of large language models, the true value lies in the dramatic reallocation of human time and effort away from menial tasks and towards more creative work. We consider the entity extraction task of the LLM to be \"well-defined\" and menial because it consists of answering the same questions over and over: (1) Is this text a name? (2) If so, what is the role of the named entity? A human could be expected to perform well at this task, but the same amount of effort could be more effective when applied to something more complex. For instance, reviewing the context of an officer's mention to assess whether their actions reveal bias against a client, or incorporating this case information with other case files featuring the same officer."

    "To determine which features are most important in our models, we've established an absolute threshold of 0.3333. This threshold represents the weighted mean of the importance scores for our three features across all models and document types, with weights based on each model's R² score. This approach ensures that features from better-performing models have a stronger influence on the threshold. The R² score, ranging from 0 to 1, indicates how well each model fits the data, with higher scores suggesting better predictive performance. Features with importance scores above the 0.3333 threshold are considered crucial, while those below are less influential. Generally, an R² score above 0.7 is considered good, above 0.8 is very good, and above 0.9 is excellent.\n",

    "The R² score for most models in this analysis fall in the good to very good range for report documents, while transcript documents show more varied performance. We examined three features: average entity length, the percentage of single-word entities, and the percentage of multi-word entities. These features often exceed or approach the 0.3333 threshold, indicating their significance in predicting the f-beta score. Across most models, the percentage of single-word entities tends to have high feature importance, particularly for report documents. However, there's notable variation between models and document types. For instance, Haiku and Sonnet models often show higher importance for average entity length in report documents, while Mixtral models show more balanced distribution across features. This suggests that while all three features are significant, their relative impact on the f-beta score prediction differs between models and document types."

    "While LLMs demonstrate impressive capabilities in entity extraction, it's important to recognize the unique strengths of human analysis in information processing. Humans prioritize information based on its utility for decision-making, assigning higher value to details that increase their insight and understanding of a situation [4]. In the context of legal document analysis, human readers excel at intuitively identifying and focusing on the most crucial information, even if they might miss some less critical entities (e.g. extracting 16 our of 17 entities from a 185-page document). Although LLMs initially lack this intuitive prioritization, we can design iterative pipelines that approximate human-like behavior. By implementing a multi-pass approach - first using LLMs for broad entity extraction, then refining the focus based on initial findings - we can simulate the human ability to hone in on critical information. This approach combines the speed and consistency of LLMs with a more nuanced, human-like discernment of importance, enabling efficient processing of vast document corpora while ensuring the most valuable information is identified and prioritized."
