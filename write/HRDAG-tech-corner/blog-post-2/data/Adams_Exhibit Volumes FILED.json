C. Cr. P. art. 930.3(1), the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and\nArticle 1, Sections 2, 13, 16, 22 and 24 of the Louisiana Constitution, to vacate Mr. Adams's\n1990 conviction of second degree murder and sentence of life without parole. The parties further\nmove this Court to order his immediate release from the custody of the Department of\nCorrections. In support of this motion, the State and the Petitioner represent to this Court the\nfollowing, which is supported by the attached exhibits 1-13.\n1. Mr. Adams was indicted on October 9, 1980, for the first degree murder of Cathy Ulfers,\nwho was shot and killed at her home at 3973 Downman Road, New Orleans on October 7, 1979.\nMr. Adams was originally tried on August 10-12, 1983 at a trial in which Ronald Bodenheimer\nand Harold Gilbert represented the State of Louisiana. Mr. Adams was convicted of first degree\nmurder and sentenced to life in prison. His conviction was reversed by the Louisiana Supreme\nCourt in 1989. State v. Adams, 550 So.2d 595 (La. 1989). Mr. Adams was re-tried for the same\nmurder, with the indictment amended to second degree murder, in 1990. Exhibit 9. Different\nassistant district attorneys prosecuted the second trial. The evidence against Mr. Adams at both\ntrials consisted exclusively of a confession to the murder, made to Detectives Martin Venezia\nand Frank Ruiz while Mr. Adams was in the custody of the Orleans Parish Criminal Sheriff's\nOffice. Exhibit 1. Mr. Adams was convicted by a jury with a verdict of 10-2 and sentenced to\nmandatory life without parole. Exhibit 9. The \"confession\" was in many ways inaccurate and\ninconsistent with the known facts of Cathy Ulfers's murder. Exhibits 1, 2.\nPage 1 of 4 .\nEXHIBIT\n6\ntabbies*",

Before his first trial, the defense filed in a timely fashion a Motion for Bill of Particulars,\nDiscovery and Inspection; a Motion for Bill of Particulars; and a Motion for Discovery and\nInspection. Exhibit 4(a-c). Those motions included a request for the \"reports of any scientific\nexamination and tests which were conducted in the case [including] any and all ballistics tests\nand experiments.\" Exhibit 4q. They also included a request asking, \"[w]hat items or substances\nwere seized by the State relative to this matter?\" and \"[w]hat is the exact location from which\neach of these items or substances were seized?\" and \"[w]ho ran tests or analysis of the items and\nsubstances involved herein?\" Exhibit 46. The same motion asked, \"[d]oes the State know or any\nof its witnesses know of any person who has information exculpatory as to the defendant, and if\nso, who is that person and what is the basis of his or her information?\" Id. The defense also\nasked the State to, \"describe in detail any and all evidence or information that the State has,\neither in its possession or which it has knowledge of, that would arguably tend to exculpate or\nhelp the defendant in the preparation of his defense or to impeach any witness that the State\nintends in this prosecution?\" Id. The defense also made general requests for results of scientific\ntests and exculpatory evidence. Exhibit 4c. The State's discovery responses answer each of these\nquestions with \"none\", \"not applicable\" or \"n/a.\" Exhibits 4d-f. .\n3.\nAdditionally the two homicide detectives who testified at Mr. Adams's first trial (Sam\nGebbia and Martin Venezia) misrepresented that no evidence or other suspects had been found in\nthe case until Mr. Adams confessed. Exhibit 8. Only Det. Venezia testified at the second trial.\nHe again falsely testified under oath that no evidence or suspects were found until Mr. Adams\nconfessed. Id.\nA review of the District Attorney's files in this and related matters indicates that there\n4.\nwas manifest intentional prosecutorial misconduct by the two prosecutors who prepared and tried\nthe case in Mr. Adams's first trial, namely Ronald Bodenheimer and Harold J. Gilbert Jr ., and\nthat the responses filed by prosecutors Bodenheimer and Gilbert to the enumerated discovery\nrequests above were knowingly and materially false, A detailed supplemental police report,\nauthored by Detectives Gebbia and Venezia, shows that the gun used to kill Cathy Ulfers and\njewelry stolen from the Ulfers' home at the time of the murder were recovered by police within a\nmonth of the crime and traced to two people who had no connection to Mr. Adams, Exhibit 2.\nPage 2 of 4",

            "page_content": "-.\nOne of those people, Roland Burns, was, in fact, arrested for accessory to the murder and\ncharged by the District Attorney's Office with possession of stolen property from the Ulfers\nhome. Exhibits 2, 12. After Mr. Adams's first murder trial, these documents were not placed in\nthe District Attorney's file relating to the homicide prosecution of Mr. Adams nor were they\nrevealed to the defense lawyers in the second trial or the prosecutors in the second trial.\n5. This police report, which relates to the murder, was likewise not contained in the District\nAttorney's file on the homicide, but was instead placed in the District Attorney's file on the\nsecond charge against Mr. Adams -- a burglary charge of which Mr. Adams was acquitted: case\nnumber 277-976 \"C\"-which Mr. Bodenheimer and Mr. Gilbert also prosecuted prior to the first\nmurder trial of Mr. Adams. The report was also contained in the District Attorney's file on the\nRoland Burns charge (Orleans Parish Case No. 273-259 \"C\"). Exhibit 12. However, in no way\nwas this patently exculpatory and highly favorable evidence revealed to the attorneys defending\nMr. Adams in either trial or the prosecutors handling the second trial.\n6.\nTherefore, in clear violation of the Fourteenth Amendment right to Due Process, as\noutlined in Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963) and its progeny, there was an intentional\nsuppression of material, exculpatory evidence by the two original prosecutors and false\ninformation provided by the detectives at Mr. Adams's trial. If this evidence had not been\nintentionally withheld, it could have and would have been used by the defense to undermine\nsubstantially the State's case against Mr. Adams, cast further doubt on the credibility of Mr.\nAdams's confession, and demonstrate third party guilt. Because the misrepresentations made by\nthe assistant district attorneys prosecuting the first trial were relied upon by the prosecutors and\ndefense at the second trial (Exhibit 9) the suppression of the material exculpatory evidence taints\nthe fundamental fairness of, and undermines confidence in, the outcome of both proceedings.\nWHEREFORE, the State and the Petitioner move this Court to grant their joint motion\nfor post-conviction relief, vacate Mr. Adams's conviction and sentence, and order his immediate\nrelease from custody.\nPage 3 of 4",

            "page_content": "police officers engaged in the investigation of Ulfers murder and misconduct of certain Assistant\nDistrict Attorneys responsible for prosecuting the case against Adams in 1983.\nIn preparation for filing an application for post-conviction relief for Adams, his attorneys\nreviewed public records relating to his investigation and trial. The documents revealed that\ncertain police and prosecutors intentionally concealed material evidence that was favorable to\nAdams. Michael Magner, a former Assistant United States Attorney and current partner in the\nlaw firm of Jones Walker, and Emily Maw, the director of the New Orleans Innocence Project,\npromptly authenticated the findings and delivered a detailed report to the District Attorney's\noffice on May 2nd.\nFollowing a quick but thorough review by senior level prosecutors in the office, District\nAttorney Cannizzaro agreed to join the motion of Reginald Adams for a new trial and dismiss the\nmurder case against him. In Response to today's proceedings, District Attorney Leon\nCannizzaro said, \"I will not tolerate intentional misconduct on the part of police or\nprosecutors. Their handling of this case was shameful. Not only did their intentional acts harm\nReginald Adams, who was wrongfully incarcerated for more than three decades, but also it\ndenied this community any opportunity to hold the real perpetrator criminally responsible for this\nviolent crime.\"\nAdditionally, District Attorney Cannizzaro offered an apology to Mr. Adams, \"To Reginald\nAdams I offer a sincere apology. I offer the apology both personally and on behalf of a much\ndifferent office than the office that prosecuted you three decades ago and denied you your right\nto a fair trial.\"\nOn October 7th of 1979, Cathy Ulfers, the wife of an NOPD officer and the daughter of a retired\nNOPD major, was shot seven times in her home in the 3900 block of Downman Road in New\nOrleans East. The perpetrators of the crime ransacked the house and stole several pieces of\njewelry from Ulfers and her husband.\nNOPD homicide detectives Martin Venezia and Sam Gebbia investigated the murder. For nearly\na year the case remained officially unsolved. In September of 1980, Reginald Adams was an\ninmate in the Orleans Parish Prison awaiting trial on a burglary charge unrelated to the Ulfers\nhomicide for which he was ultimately acquitted. However, NOPD Homicide detectives\ninvestigating the Ulfers murder were aware of street rumors that Adams had murdered Cathy\nUlfers.\nWhen Adams requested a meeting with the detectives on his burglary case, detective Venezia\naccompanied one of the detectives on the burglary case to speak with Adams. Following a four\nand a half hour interrogation in which Adams claims to have been given alcohol and narcotics,\nhe made a taped confession. Some of the claims made by Adams in the confession were\ninconsistent with the physical evidence.\n2",

            "page_content": "Following the confession, Adams was arrested by the homicide detectives and charged by the\nDistrict Attorney's office with the murder of Cathy Ulfers. In August of 1983, Assistant District\nAttorneys Ronald Bodenheimer and Harold Gilbert, who were the ADAs who unsuccessfully\ntried Adams on the unrelated burglary charge, tried Adams for the murder of Ulfers. The case\nwas based entirely on the confession of Adams.\nDuring trial and in response to discovery requests, the detectives testified and prosecutors\nclaimed that neither the murder weapon nor any of the property taken from the home were ever\nrecovered by police. Additionally, the detectives testified that no other suspects were ever\ndeveloped or investigated for the murder. Following the trial, Adams was convicted of the\nmurder and received a life sentence.\nIn their review of public records relating to the murder case as well as the unrelated burglary,\nMichael Magner and Emily Maw discovered a supplemental police report detailing the first\nseveral months of the murder investigation in 1979. The report revealed that on October 24th of\n1979 the homicide detectives in this case were notified that a weapon similar to the weapon used\nin the Ulfers murder had been recovered in an arrest. According to the report, the homicide\ndetectives were later informed by an NOPD ballistics expert that the recovered weapon was the\nmurder weapon.\nIn one of the sad ironies of this case, the detectives, based on this discovery, performed a\nthorough follow up investigation that traced the weapon back to two individuals. The detectives\nquestioned and searched one of the two individuals, and they discovered that he was in\npossession of a piece of jewelry that had been taken from the Ulfers' home in the burglary.\nWhile this individual was arrested as an accessory to the murder and for possession of stolen\nproperty and eventually charged by the DA's office with possession of stolen property, the\ncharges were dismissed by prosecutors months before Adams confessed and years before he was\nbrought to trial for the murder of Cathy Ulfers.\nThe testimony given by detectives Venizia and Gebbia at trial was unquestionably inconsistent\nwith the information contained in the supplemental report. Furthermore, the investigation of\nMagner and Maw revealed that the aforementioned report was in the possession of the District\nAttorney's office. They discovered that it was contained in the file regarding the unrelated\nburglary charge against Adams. In light of the fact that Assistant District Attorneys\nBodenhiemer and Gilbert handled both cases, the current administration of the District\nAttorney's office concludes that Bodenheimer and Gilbert were fully aware of the additional\nsuspects as well as the recovery of the murder weapon and other physical evidence and that their\nhandling of this case amounts to intentional prosecutorial misconduct.\n3",

Sergeant Kirsch stated that\nhis suspicion was aroused when Halphera mentioned burglaries in the New Orleans Bast\narea (Mrs. Ulfers was murdered during the perpetration of a burglary on her residence,\nwhich is in the New Orleans East area). It was determined that Sergeant Kirsch, along\nwith the remainder of the Special Investigations Division, had been instructed by their\nsuperiors to question all informants relative to the Ulfers's Murder.\nPer the request of Detective Venezia, Lionel Halphern was transported to the Spec-\nial Investigations Division's Office for the purpose of an interview.

Halphern disclosed sundry Information during this interview, however, the\nmajority of it did not apply to the murder investigation. When questioned directly\nabout the murder of Mrs. Ulfers, Halphern feigned ignorance. Upon further questioning\nby Detective Venezia, Halphern stated that he had heard \"from talk in the street\" that\nAddma and Duport were involved in the murder. However, Halphern refused to reveal this\nsource of information, stating that he couldn't recall the names of the people who had\nstatad thia. Halphern did state that if Detective Venezia could arrange his release\nfrom Parish Prison, he (Halphern) would seek further information. It became apparent\nto Detective Venezia, due to the unsurenasas of Halphern relative to details of his\nInformation, that Halphern was repeating, at best, second-hand information.

Detective Venezia determined that Santinac was still\nconfined in. Parish Frison, having been sentenced to six months for violation of parole\n( the armed robbery charge had been dismissed the the District Attorney's Office for\nlack of evidence). On the following day, Tuesday, May 7, 1980, Detective Venezia con-\nducted a Lengthy interview with Santinas in the Special Investigations Division's Off-\nIce. The information gleaned from this interview is as follows.\nOver the past several years, Santinac has committed several residence and business\nburglaries with John Dupart, Raymond Dupart, and Reginald Adams. On occassions, it\nwould be Santinac and any one or all of the named individuals, who would commit theme\nburglaries. According to Santinac, the property gathered during these burglaries would\nbe sold to a white male named \"Shitcase Tony\" -- this La an alias by which Anthony Calcagno\nto well known. It was Sentinac's beliaf, based upon conversations with his confeder-\nates, that, Calcagno would choose the intended victims, conduct the necessary surveilance\nand supply this information to John Dupart. It was then Dupart, who furthered the con-\nspiracy by actually committing the burglary with whomever he chose. The fruits of the\nburglary were invariably sold to Calcagno. However, all of the trnasactions involving\nCalcagno were conducted only with John Dupart. None of the orther members of the burg-\nLary group were physically present during the transfer of Information and/or stolen\ngoods. This did not preclude them from being in the same residence where the transfer\nwould occur, but they would not be privy to any inculpatory acts of Calcagno.\nAs regards the Ulfers's murder, Santinac recalls overhearing Calcagno telling\nRaymond Dupart, \"Reggie and your brother Sucked-up, they shouldn't have shot the broad.\nAccording to Santinac, this conversation occurred inside of Mel's Upholstery Shop,\nlocated 2000 Touro Street, sometime in the early part of October, 1979.

The interview was\nconcluded with no further information gathered.\nOn Tuesday, May 7, 1980, at about 4:00 P.M ., Detective Venezia proceeded to the\n2000 block of Touro Street and observed a one story, beige brick structure with \"Mel's\nUpholstery Shop\" written across one window. This atructure had only one observable\npoint of ingress, that being a doorway opening onto the downtown-lake corner of Touro\nand North Johnson Streets. At the time Datactive Venezia passed the shop, it appeared\nto be closed for business.\nAfter consultation with Lieutenant Ronald Reyes, the Commander of the Homicide\nUnit during this period of time, it was decided to forward this information to the\ncareer Offenders Unit, and have them conduct the necessary investigation into the Do-\nparts and Calcagno. In the event any of these parties would be apprehended for a crime\nthey would be questioned at that time for knowledge of the Ulfers's Murder.\nThis tact was chosen because of the tentious nature of the information and the fact that\n-\nall the involved parties were professional criminals, who have proven themselves to be\nuncooperative with law enforcement agencies, unless they had something to barter fot,\nsuch as ., if they themselves were charged with a crime, There were no results from this\nrequest.\nIt should be noted at this time, that investigation into this lead was stymied\nbecause of a lack a common denominator batwenn the listed criminals and the Ulfera's\nfamily. Further, the investigating detective is aware that Calcagno limits his crimes\nto the major type, where he would gain a substantial amount of money. Nothing about\nthe Ulfera's residence, or their lifestyles, would render the Ulfers's residence &\npotential target of a Calcagno inspired burglary, Both of these points were later\nestablished in further investigation, which shall be enumerated later in this narrative.\nThe next major occurrance of this case occurred on Monday, August 4, 1980, when\nDetective Venezia received a telephone call from Sergeant Frank Ruiz, the chief invest-\nigator for the District Attorney's Office, requesting that he, Venezia, immediately\ncome over to his, Ruiz's, office.

According to Mise Santinac, she had Learned from a black male\nsubject, age 16, known to her as \"PeeWee\", that Adams had murdered the Policeman's wife\non Downman Road.

There was\nsome sligh't indication of Adam's involvement in the Ulfers's murder in this tape, but\nthe information was very ambiguous.\nOn Tuesday, August $, 1980, Detective Venezia determined that the owner of the\nupholstery shop was a Malvin Patnett, negro mala, date of birth -- November 12, 1926, re-\nsiding 5919 Pauline Street. A check of Patnett through the MOTION files disclosed that\nhe was wantad for simple criminal damage, under N.O.P.D. Item Number -- D-26137-80. A\nreview of the report filed under this item number revealed that a Miss Deane Clemans,\nnegro female, age 32, residing 5404 St. Roch Street, was the individual who filed the\ncomplaint against Patnett. In order to gain background information on Mr. Patnett,\nDetective Venezia telephone Mosa Clemans and set an appointment for the following day\nat Niss Cleman's residence.\nOn Wednesday, August 6, 1980, at 9:30 A.M ., Detective Venezia interviewed Miss\nClemens, who could supply nothing concerning the Ulfer's murder. She did advise the\nDetective that Mel Patnett was her ex-boyfriend, but that they had not seen each other\nsince April 25, 1980, when he caused damage to her vehicle. Clemans related that dur-\ning her association with Patnett, they would often double date with John Dupart, who was\napparently a very good friend of Patnett. Upon conclusion of this interview, Mins\nClemans stated that she still wished to prosecute Pacnett for the damage done to her\nvehicle.\nLater that same day, at about 11:30 A.M ., Detective Venezia met with Sergeant Ruiz\nin the Office of the District Attorney, in order to compare noted concerning the in-\nvestigation to date, After a period of consultation, both officers decided to again\nquestion John Santinac and Marguerite Santinac, so they felt that neither party was '\ncompletely truthfull.

But just suffice it\n28\nto say, especially in light of the new evidence that's now\n29\nknown, pretty much every fact of this crime when you compare\n30\nthe text of Mr. Adam's confession, which is attached as\nExhibit 1 in that packet of materials, to the actual facts\n31\nof this crime, just about every fact Mr. Adams could have\n32\nMARLENE C.
